# PREDICTIVE-RISK-AGENT-
This project implements an AI-powered Predictive Risk Agent designed to anticipate project delays or employee churn using machine learning. The system not only identifies individuals or tasks at high risk but also provides actionable recommendations—such as assigning a mentor, adjusting workload, or notifying managers—creating a fully automated, interpretable, and responsive decision loop.

#ABOUT PROJECT - 

This system combines machine learning predictions with an agentic decision pipeline:
Predict: Identify employees or projects at risk
Interpret: Analyze risk level and key indicators
Recommend: Suggest interventions like mentoring, training, or task redistribution
Notify: Trigger alerts via UI, Slack, or email for rapid action
The frontend dashboard visualizes the results and recommendations in a user-friendly way, helping HR managers or project leads act immediately.

IMPACT STATEMENT - 

By proactively identifying risk patterns in workforce or project metrics, this agent helps organizations:
Reduce costly employee churn
Prevent project timeline failures
Empower managers with data-backed, real-time actions
Automate repetitive decision tasks with intelligent reasoning
